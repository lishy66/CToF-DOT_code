# CToF-DOT Code

Attached is the associated code for our CToF-DOT publication [1]. The code for each figure (assuming it required a simulation or image reconstruction) is placed in its own directory. Within each directory, you will find a RUNME program which should should run out-of-the-box. Note, most programs will create a `fig/` directory at the same level as this package. In this `fig/` directory, you will find the output/plots for the program. Most datasets also require data. This dataset for each program can be found at [this link](https://rice.box.com/s/lykgcol5o3ltrf9m92myqhcjv6rj4736). Please download the file, rename the directory to `dat`, and place the folder in the top level directory before running.

Misc. Notes:
1. Our image reconstructions use the FISTA linear inverse solver [2]. 
2. To run our code, you must separately download certain plotting programs. The copyright notices for these codes are included in the file `copyright_info.txt` They are listed below along with the directory in which they should be placed:
- export_fig (place in top level directory): https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export_fig
- voxel (place in the directory: lib/): https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/3280-voxel
- vol3d (place in the directory: lib/): https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22940-vol3d-v2
3. Please note, a small modification was made to the vol3d function, and so it is included in this package
